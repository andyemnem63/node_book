# LearningNodeJS


Source code to accompany my book, "Learning Node.JS, Second Edition".  Every once
in a while, I'll update to the latest version of Node.JS and let everybody know
if there are any  changes or updates required to the code (and will make those
changes in the source tree).

## First Edition

Source code for the first edition is available via the
[branch v1](https://github.com/marcwan/LearningNodeJS/tree/v1).


## Errors and Corrections

As devastating as it is to admit, there are a couple of errors in the book.
Those responsible for these egregious violations of editorial process (me)
have been shot.

(none yet!!)
